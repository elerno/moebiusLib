moebiusLib
==========

Moebius Matrix Library,
an algorithmic composition library inspired on chaos theory and written in python 
with csound.


ABOUT
-----

A Python library that generates a "Moebius Progressions" and transposition
Matrix as concieved by composer Ernesto Illescas-Peláez in his Master's
thesis "An Organizing Tide of Chaos - Resonances of Chaos Theory in a Composer's
Craftsmanship" (link to the full text below). 

This library takes two starting parameters: a starting pitch and missing pitch. It
generates a numeric representation of a TET tone-row and a transposition matrix
derived from iterating a simple function. Additionally, it provides methods to
manipulate this data.
