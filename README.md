moebiusLib
==========

Moebius Matrix Library,
an algorithmic composition library based on chaos theory and written in python 
with csound.


ABOUT
-----

A Python library that generates a "Moebius Progressions" and transposition
Matrix as concieved by composer Ernesto Illescas-Peláez in his Master's
thesis "An Organizing Tide of Chaos - Resonances of Chaos Theory in a Composer's
Craftsmanship" (link to the full text below). 

This library takes two starting parameters: a starting pitch and missing pitch. It
generates a numeric representation of a TET tone-row and a transposition matrix
derived from iterating a simple function. Additionally, it provides methods to
manipulate this data.

AUTHORS
-------

Moebius Matrix Library is coded by Edgar Becerra-Santillán and Ernesto
Illescas-Peláez, members of the CL Free Software Development Collective.


LICENSING
---------

The main decision here is whether, as a library, we allow it to be used to create proprietary works. It is also necessary to find out what the implications are of using the GPL for a library. I, Jergas, lean towards GPL V3 with the Affero clause.
I, elerno, have read the GPL V3 and agree with it, while considering that the
Affero clause might not be necessary for this project. Why include it, Jergas?

HOW TO
------

TODO (will contain instructions on using the library. Does this make sense?)
