ROADMAP
=======


- Stage 1
	- Write documentation
		- README (in progress).
		- This text (in progress).
		- License (in progress).
		- Coding conventions (done?).
	- Code moebiusLib.Progression() basic methods and (generated) attributes.
		- Write an __init__() for the class. The init will invoke:
			- code processInitialConditions(), which will:
				- range(0, 12)
				- rotate until starting pitch is the first element of the list.
				- remove missingPitch from the list.
				- record the list in the Progression.pitches attribute.
			- code makeProgression(), which will construct a moebius tone-row,
				and make it available to the class through  the
				Progression.complete attribute.
			- code determineNonLoopingSection(), which will determine if the
				specific tone-row has a non-looping section. If so, make it
				available to the class through  the
				Progression.nonLoopingSection attribute.
			- code determineLoopingSection(), which will determine the
				tone-row's looping section, and make it available to
				the class through  the Progression.loopingSection attribute.
	- Code moebiusLib.Matrix() basic methods and (generated) attributes.
		- Use moebiusLib.Progression() as super-class for Matrix()
- Stage 2
	- Code moebiusLib.Progression() more sophisticaded methods
		(and attributes?).
		- code methods to generate the tone-row identities: retrograde, inverse
			and inverse-retrograde.
	- Code moebiusLib.Matrix() more sophisticaded methods (and attributes?).
- Stage 3
	- Review the code
		- Optimize if necessary.
		- Polish docstrings and comments if necessary.
	- Write any missing documentation.
- Stage 4 (wishlist)
	- Code moebiusLib.Progression() experimental methods (and attributes?).
		- add optional arguments to makeProgression() or __init__ in order to
			experiment with different modulos and/or constants in the iterated
			function (2x = y).
		- make experimental methods in order to iterate different formulae?
		- implement modular systems other than Twelve-tone equal temperament
			(TET).
	- Code moebiusLib.Matrix() experimental methods (and attributes?).
	- Code moebiusLib.Harmnoy() basic methods and (generated) attributes.
- Stage 5
	- Review the code
		- Optimize if necessary.
		- Polish docstrings and comments if necessary.
	- Write any missing documentation.
